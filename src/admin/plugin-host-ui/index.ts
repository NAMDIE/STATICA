/**
 * `@pagebuilder/host-ui` — the named-export host UI surface plugins import.
 *
 *   import { Button, Stack, Card, Text } from '@pagebuilder/host-ui'
 *
 *   export default function MyPanel() {
 *     return <Stack gap={12}><Button variant="primary">Hi</Button></Stack>
 *   }
 *
 * Plugins compile against these named exports as a stable contract. The
 * runtime resolution at editor mount time is handled by the host's import
 * map (see `public/runtime/host-ui.js`) — the plugin's bundle treats this
 * package as an external. That means:
 *
 *   • Plugin bundles never ship the host's design system code.
 *   • The host can refactor its primitives freely; this file's named
 *     exports are the contract.
 *   • One copy of every component runs in the editor: identical theming,
 *     identical accessibility wiring, identical event semantics.
 *
 * The components are the wrappers from `PluginAdminUiComponents.tsx` —
 * already battle-tested by the existing plugin admin pages. Re-exporting
 * them here under stable names is the migration path from the curated
 * `ui` namespace to a proper React component package.
